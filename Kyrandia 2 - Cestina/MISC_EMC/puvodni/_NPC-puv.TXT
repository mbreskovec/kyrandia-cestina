I don't feel so good...
Uh oh...
Somebody get a mop, quick!
Oh no! I think I'm gonna hurl too!
Quick, get her wallet!
Let's leave before the sheriff finds out about this!
Well, I am a little thirsty...
_ZMEDUSA.EMC
Eeesh! That can't be good for my split ends.
Hurry up!
You know, I've always loved you.
Nice!
Great trick... But where are my letters?
Excellent!
<Gulp!>
That didn't help my breath.
Yeech.
Yow! Hot!
_ZSICK.EMC
Eeew! Salty and fishy!
Ooh. Crunchy blueberries.
Euuw. I didn't like that!
This looks like Faun's size.
Hey! The bark on this branch is still moving.
I wonder if this belonged to a pirate?
I'm not a plant.
Ooh, that stinks.
I should turn this lead anchor to gold.
That's a lot of gold.
That tickles!
Now I feel like a real alchemist.
Blech!
I don't feel any faster.
Ahhh.
Yuuuuck!
Ow! That burned my tongue.
A little too warm for my tastes.

I wonder where I can get this guy a body?
Not bad.
I don't think I wanted to eat that.
Hmm. Soft.
Needs dressing.
Crunchy.
I haven't seen any horses around.
I have a funny feeling about this horseshoe.
A miracle of science.
Oh no! Last time I cut my hair I invented the mohawk!
Never again!
Ooh that's hot.
Breakfast of heroes.
I wonder if this bowl would make a nice hat?
Farmer Greenberry's original recipe.
Too rough for my taste.
Eeew! That's like warm yogurt.
Ooh, tangy!
I wish I had a hammer...
I could make a gold coin out of this.
Who would want a lead tooth?
Who would want a lead slug?
Now this looks like a coin.
Now all I need are some egg rolls.
I'm tired of doing the orange-mouth joke.
Hey, it's a key.
Normally I abhor fishing.
This voucher good only on day of issue...

Only good at participating locations.
Hmm. Last time I had to pay twelve crowns for a mud facial.
Aren't I the clever little scout?
Burp!
Excuse me.
That tasted like Dragon-Chow.
Very inexpensive vintage
I don't think I needed to do that.
I can't believe I did that.
Hey Mr. Stick, are you following me?
Don't they ever wash these things?
_ZDRINK.EMC
Too much sweet stuff!
I couldn't possibly drink any more.
I'm definitely not going to drink any more!
I feel seasick.
_ZTAFFY.EMC

Volcanian currency.
My poor dress.
He's so cute.
"Full Guide Services: Six starfish."
Nice leather.
That tickles.
These might be worth something.
Why am I carrying this around?
Gold is really doing me a lot of good on this adventure.
What's with all the lead?
Too bad I can't buy anything with this.
This makes perfect dead weight.
I bet Breuth would love this.
Shake it up and it snows.
Fuzz.
Look's kind of like that ghost.
I could plant these in my garden.
Flying shoes!
No more for now.
Aha! It had a teddy bear in it.
Winged shoes!
Instant sandwich!
Reminds me of the fishermen.
I bet these would make nice charcoal if I burned them.
Beautiful charcoal.
At least it's not yellow.
A cute miniature lawn.
It keeps going and going.
These were smaller when I was a girl.
Drums give me a headache.
Dusty feathers.
Hey! I'm an Alchemist, not a witch!

Spare parts are always hard to get.
A magic party whistle!

I feel so... racy.
A magic whistle!
Smells almost as good as ol' loverboy.
Where have I seen this before?
Hmm. A small inscription...
"ROY G. BIV"
More gobbledegook I guess.
No time to play now.
Too bad this isn't my size.
Remind's me of a fairy I once beat up.
High quality wax.
Chilly.
Oh great. Now I've got pitch on my hands.
Brandon used to carry pocketfulls of these.
I hate walnuts.
Looks like the sandwich potion.
Smells like blueberries.
Ooh. Purple Sparkles...
I'll bet this would make a nice indigo potion.
Looks like the Flying Shoes potion.
Looks like the Teddy Bear potion.

Error: This shouldn't happen.
My trusty camping cauldron...
I wouldn't leave home without it.
