       I have moved back to Mother's house.
Ever since you lost your job at the bridge, life
has been unbearable.  That stupid green color of
your complexion, and the maniacal way you constantly
swing that saw around are enough to drive me nuts!
Best of luck in your new job as cheese cutter.

                              Josephine
