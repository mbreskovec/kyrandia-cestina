Nobody leaves without reciting a poem.$
_ZPOUR.EMC$
Nice keg.$
What rustic furniture.$
My dentist would have loads of fun with these.$
Looks like Brandon's picture.$
Is it getting dark out, or is it just me?$
Isn't that Kallak's?$
Nobody seems to be using this.$
-Ahem-$
Excuse me...$
HEY!$
Thank you.$
Nobody barfs,$
Much on the wharfs,$
But rub a dub dub,$
And most lose their grub.$
Heave, heave,$
Ho, ho,$
Over the rail your biscuits go.$
Is that a toad stool?$
Or maybe a toad podium?$
I don't think I need any more taffy.$
I wonder if this taffy is safe to eat?$
It was bad for my teeth, anyway.$
The barrel is already full of some sweet-smelling, goopy mass.$
Rustic furniture must be back in style.$
Hey! These pirates aren't afraid of me!$
What would I need with that?$
He's getting ready.$
Don't break his concentration.$
I miss my Mommy.$
Is that stolen?$
I miss my Daddy.$
Hey, watch it.$
I miss my Teddy Bear.$
No, thank you.$
*SQUAWK!*$
Everyone has to recite a poem before they can leave.$
I lost the leg going after some cheese in a mousetrap.$
Do I look like I need that?$
It's Pirate Poetry Night.$
Hey! Get out of my way wench!$
Hush! He's about to begin!$
Thirsty Dick Richard|
Went down to the water,$
His momma said 'Dickey, don't wade,$
|
In over your knees.'$
But alas, for her pleas,|
Went unheeded, and most unobeyed.$
For young Rick was quick,|
To dive in, and stick,$
In the mud,|
Headlong and headfirst.$
And as much as he'd squirm,|
And gyrate like a worm,$
His problem was breathing, not thirst.$
Do wah, de water,|
Dickey, Dickey don't wade.$
Do wah, de water,|
Do what your mom said.$
Dip de dip,|
But don't slip,$
Won't you please try,|
To keep your knees dry?$
You wouldn't recognize iambic pentameter if it bit you on the butt.$
Oh? And I suppose you're a Haiku expert!$
Don't touch me!$
Stay out of this, Lady!$
I mean it!$
Get that away from me!$
I'm busy!$
Get out you illiterate cretin!$
Interfere and I'll slit yer gizzard!$
You stay out of this!$
Hey! Thats MY gold tooth!$
Who built this?$
