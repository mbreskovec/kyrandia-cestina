Is that an elevator?
I don't want to do that.
Wow, that's hot!
Clear water.
I'm not giving them THAT!
Do you know how I can get down to the center of the world?
You have come to the right place my dear.

You only lack four more sand dollars.
You only lack three more sand dollars.
You only lack two more sand dollars.
