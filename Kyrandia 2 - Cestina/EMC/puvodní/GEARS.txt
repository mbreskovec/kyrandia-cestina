Ugh! How disgusting!
At least Kyrandia is safe now.
Sure, but I shouldn't have had to do all this in the first place!
Did I hear you say 'Thanks Marko, for all your help?'
Thanks, Marko, for all your help.
Please stop. You're making me blush.
Okay! Okay!
I couldn't have done it without you.
Happy now?
Come on sweetheart, let's go home...
I've got two magic parachutes hidden outside.
Sweetheart?!?

Kyrandia is saved!
My poor stick!

I'll need something with more leverage to push it all the way on.
Hmm. An empty spindle?
The gear isn't on all the way...
I know that Hand must have done this!
Now I need something to wedge the gear back on.
I know that won't work on the spindle.
I can't risk my Alchemy Magnet.
That stick won't work on the spindle.
That won't help!
That doesn't look good.
Aha! This is the poor little fellow that's caused all the trouble.
The gear doesn't look on all the way...
This one's running okay.
This one seems to be running right.
No trouble here.
I'd like to see the blueprints for this place!
What a strange factory!
I'd better not leave anything up in here.
