An acorn.
This is the foot of Bal-Rom...
...an ancient and evil wizard that lived in a galaxy far far away.
He perpetrated one hideous crime after another...
...until finally the Forces of Justice banded together...
...and launched an Astro-Bomb that blew Bal-Rom and his evil planet to bits.
After centuries of drifting in space...
...Bal-Rom's parts have begun to land.
We have one of the feet here...
...and have reports that his nose landed in Miltonia.
By themselves, these parts aren't actually too dangerous.
What we really have to watch out for is his left hand.
That vile appendage will certainly head for the Wheels of Fate...
...and try to erase some innocent realm...
...in order to provide Bal-Rom with a suitable void in which to reassemble.
FOOT
Thanks for the help.
He is rather slippery.
What the heck is that?
A wild foot or what?
Uh oh.
A magic drum...
A Frank Klepacki special!
One jack?
No more toys.
Back in you go.
That box is only for toys.
What does this box have to do with that statue?
That's a lovely trinket...
Can it get rid of this foot odor problem?
Those guys look pretty busy.
I don't think they'd want it.
My, what a dented statue.
Even the dents look shiny now!
I wonder who prunes these?
I already have a snowball here on the ground.
I already have a snowball.
I left a snowball lying around somewhere.
A snowball.
This must be the Enchanted Archipelago.
I wonder who dug that hole?
