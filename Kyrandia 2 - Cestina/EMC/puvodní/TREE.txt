I'll put this on the stump.
Maybe this will loosen them up.
Ouch! I need a stunt mystic.
This outfit is a little delicate for the rough terrain.
Not without my Alchemist's Magnet!
Must be sandstone.
Maybe I could start a fire with this flint rock.
Aha! Charcoal!
Hmm.  Flint.
Please don't do that!
I hope this works!
Is that granite?
Ha.  Fool's gold.
Some lumberjack must have been busy.
All that banging is giving me a headache.
Not the softest landing pad in the world.
Hmm. Another flask.
Boy!  I must have been falling faster than I thought.
I'd better not lose this in the hole.
One of these would look good in my yard.
I just want to dance again.
Are you trying to trick us?
This path must go somewhere.
Did you guys drop this pinecone?
You can have it.
We'll make more.
