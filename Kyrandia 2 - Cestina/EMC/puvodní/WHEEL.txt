Hey! That stick is jamming the gears.
Strange, that looked like a piece of the fishing boat.
Wow! That electricity looks dangerous!
I think one magnet is enough.

Nothing happened.
There's some ground wheat in there...
If only I could scoop it out.
There's some ground radish in there...

How can I scoop it out?
The grain has been smashed...
Now I've got ground grain.
Now I've got ground radish.

I couldn't get any ground radish in time...
I'd hate to have this smashed.

I don't want to smash my stick.
I don't want to smash poor Mr. Ghost.
I don't want to destroy my shears.
I'm not even going to think about destroying that!

What a refreshing cascade.
The water is hardly flowing.

He looks grumpy.
But I'm not the one to cheer him up.
Typical Kyrandia engineering.
Why can't anything be just plain regular?
This must be where all the water comes from.
