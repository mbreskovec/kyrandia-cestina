Hey Zanthia!
Hi Zanthia, wait until you see my new rope trick.
I'm getting to be quite a good magician.
I'm sure the kids at your next birthday party will be very impressed.
Oh Zanthia, you're just jealous because I have my new assistant to help me.
Yeah, Marko, that's great.
Where is your hand anyway?
Oh he's around here somewhere.
He seems to really enjoy hiking in the swamp.
Here he is.
Hello Mr. Hand.
Are you enjoying the hike?
I'd love to stay and chat...
...but someone has stolen my equipment.
I have to walk down to the center of the world...
...to get one of those anchor stones.
What? Who would do such a thing?
I don't know or care, but I'm too busy to stand around here doing nothing!

Can we help?
Do you have any gold?
Nope. Sorry.
Please, let us help you.
I'll get it done myself, thank you though.
Strange swamp.

Swamp water.
What a bizarre affliction!
Kyrandia is disappearing right before my eyes!
