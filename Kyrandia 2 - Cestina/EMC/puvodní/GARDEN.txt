The hose doesn't work.

Wow! That must be very fertile soil!
I already watered the garden.
Those are much too small to pick.
Lettuce.
I picked them all.
A radish.
I wonder if this body will work?
Hey! Thanks!

Beautiful countryside.
Is that an elephant or an aardvark?
These pipes run everywhere.
It's probably safe to drink.
It might sink and I may never see it again.
So this is where it fell!
