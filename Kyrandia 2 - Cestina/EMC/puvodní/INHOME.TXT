I'd better change before I leave.

Yuck! This won't do!
Much better!
Yum! That was good!
As soon as you're gone, I'm going to have a party here.
No thanks.
I've got plenty of those.
Those embers are still hot!
Now the water's good and hot!
I don't want to burn that!
The embers have cooled down.
At least this wasn't stolen.
Mosquito repellent.
Too bad this isn't a magic carpet.
Senseless!
Why would someone do this?
All my glassware!
Who could be mad at me?

Aha. I can still use this!
Nothing else under there.
Who would do this?
Now who would break my Christmas ornaments?
Looks like my seven years bad luck has already started.
At least they left my things alone!
The thief didn't mess with YOUR things!
I need a maid.
Why would some thief steal my equipment?
At least I found my cauldron and my spellbook.
At least I found my cauldron.
At least I found my spellbook.
I can't even make potions...
...without a cauldron and spellbook!
Aren't you gone yet?
