The pot is empty.
Look what I found!
The coil of rope is empty.
I'm not leaving my Alchemist's Magnet in there!
Hidden safely away.
Don't be interfering with our compass, Missie!
There's already something in there.
Thank goodness for the autopilot.
No problem. We're still miles from that cursed island.

Volcania!
How could this have happened?!
We appear to be off course.
This uniform is humiliating.
No thank you.
Where's our Grog?
No thank you, Ma'am.
No thank you, I'm busy on watch.
Strange boat.
I'm not leaving my Alchemist's Magnet on this tub!
I'm not leaving my voucher here.
