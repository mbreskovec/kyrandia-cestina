FAUN
...So then I told her...
"You'd better get your butt in gear and get going or I'll"...
Faun. Faun, can you hear me?
Oops. Hi Zanthia.
Did you get the Anchor Stone?
Not yet, but I'm making progress.
How's things in Kyrandia?
You'd better hurry.
Brandon came by and told me Darm has vanished...
...and Brynn's Temple just disappeared.
Yikes!
If you don't hurry, you'll be the only Mystic left!
Then what will we do?
Thanks for the encouragement.
I'll call you later.
