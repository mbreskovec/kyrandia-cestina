"ACME Cheese Maker"
I wonder how old this cheese maker is?
Now there's milk in there.
Let's try it now.
I don't want to put that in there.

No cheese came out.
Is that cheddar or Colby?
There's already some cheese on the floor.
I already have some cheese around here somewhere.
I'm not leaving without you know what.
Where's the spiders?
There's a hole in the bottom of this.
I bet the beavers would love to see this log.
How'd he get this in here?
Why is he keeping a cracked bottle?
Why is this filled with mud?
This bottle's stuck in some wax.
That doesn't look like my kind of tool.
