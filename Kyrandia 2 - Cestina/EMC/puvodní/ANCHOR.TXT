I don't need that one.
Hmm. More rocks, more vents... I wonder...

I've made it!
I've found it!
Hey! Watch it!
Bimbo!
Come on and try!

Whoa!
Marko...
Say, he's cute!
Ta ta!
Oh no!

I'd better take that piece of parchment with me.
I'd better put that page back in my spellbook, first.
That's one huge anchor!
I think it's time to give Faun yet another buzz...
Zanthia to Faun... Zanthia to Faun...
