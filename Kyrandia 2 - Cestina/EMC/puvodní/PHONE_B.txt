FAUN
...So I mixed some of the blueberries with that yellow stuff, and Voila!...
Wait till you see what this does to my ears...
Neat, huh?
Uh oh. Hello Zanthia.
You're not messing around with my things are you?
Who me?
Any news from Kyrandia?
Things are getting worse!
The swamp looks like Swiss cheese, and I hear the Castle's almost gone.
What's taking you so long?
It's a rough trip Faun, and I'd better go.
Thanks again for your support...
...and I really appreciate that you're not messing around with my equipment.
Bye bye.
Okay. Call again when you've got some good news.
