As I remember...
This is one of the ingredients for an Indigo Potion.
An empty shelf..
I don't think this is what goes there.
There is already something there.
My what a vibrant light.
I can't tell what colored liquid was in this orb.
There is red liquid in this orb.
There is orange liquid in this orb.
There is yellow liquid in this orb.
There is green liquid in this orb.
There is blue liquid in this orb.
There is indigo liquid in this orb.
There is violet liquid in this orb.
It's empty.
Hmm... I can't seem to empty the globe.
That was fun.
I guess that rule on the sign isn't strictly enforced.
Hey! What happened to the rainbow machine?
"Nothing may be removed from this room!"
"Nothing may be put on the floor!"
"Do not reorganize the shelves!"
"Absolutely no confetti allowed!"
Unusually shoddy construction for such an important building!
Hmm. Now how can I climb up on it?
This weed is the famous Rainbow Machine?
A bottomless trash can.
I don't want to throw away my alchemy magnet.
I guess I don't need that anymore.
I shouldn't drop anything through that hole.
Hmm. I guess I can't put anything on the floor.
Congratulations!
You have found the secret potion!
Your keyboard has now become a magical sound toy...
...Have fun!
I bet this would make a lovely indigo potion.
A "schimple" child's toy...
I'm not really thirsty.
Especially for that.
I'm not in the mood for experimenting on myself right now.
I think I've had enough sweets for now.
A red piece of fabric.
