Hey, this guy's a zombie.
What a stiff.
Hmm. That wasn't strong enough.
---and then I said, "You can take your mustard.."
Hey! Where'd everybody go?
How much for a ticket on your boat?
We charge three gold coins for a ticket to ride on our ship.
Three gold coins!
That seems awfully expensive!
That didn't do squat!
I lost my voucher and need another one.
No surprise to me.
I cannot accept used dental equipment.
Yeah right, you and that stupid octopus.
I hate mustard, really.
You'll need two more gold coins.
You'll need one more gold coin.
That's it. Here's your voucher.
Sorry...
You can only buy a voucher with gold coins.
What's wrong with your map?
That's Volcania, idiot.
Is that Mustard Island?
It's not Ketchupland.
This must be Highmoon.
You must have paid attention in school.
Why is there no glass in this window?
This one's the same way.
None of these windows have glass.
Business must be good.
Odd filing system.
Who would need ten barrels of mustard?
All orders to Herb the Toad must be C.O.D.
Shouldn't these be refrigerated?
Bigger than mine.
Where's all the mustard?
