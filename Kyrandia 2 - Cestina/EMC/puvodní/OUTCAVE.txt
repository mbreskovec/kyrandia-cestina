It seems like I'm missing something.
Here come the fearless hunters.
They look determined.
Uh oh, I'm not sure that bridge will hold their weight.
They're coming this way.
Be careful, don't get too close to the edge.
I am so impressed.

Ymt ijkfe wfsd fifijur!
I don't mean to bother you...
but I need a couple of icicles.
A little fickle isn't he?

I'm trying to go up, not down.
They wouldn't even loan me a rope.
Why would I give them this?
We don't need any help from you.
I wasn't offering any!
Please, don't ever put me in a furry costume.
I'd be scared silly if an Abominable Snowman walked out of that cave!
That icicle is out of reach.
That branch wouldn't support Faun's weight.
I think I'd better I stay out of their way.
If I try it now, Mr. Romance will just come and stop me again.
That cliff is too slippery to climb.
I'd better wait and see what these guys are up to.
