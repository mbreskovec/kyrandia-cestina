What kind of idiot would keep a tavern door locked?
There. That unlocked it.
Must be the Drunk Dragon.

Hey, those aren't ships...
They're just sticks in the mud!
Drinking and Dragons don't mix.
Now that's fancy plumbing!
Hey lassie, care to try your luck?
Just find the pea.
What could be easier?
See?
Double your money!
Care to play?
Forget it lady...
I'll go broke with you around!
You really should use a lucky charm.
I knew you'd want to try your luck...
Let's go then...
Keep your eye on the pea.
Pick a shell, any shell.
What are you, a bingo player?
If you think it will help, you can put your little lucky charm anywhere you want...
I only play for gold.
Not now, sweetheart.
Just pick a shell.
You lucky scumbag!
Doop!
Here's your stinkin' money!
Just take your cash and go!
Aww, too bad.
Put that down and pick a shell!
Smells like the ocean.
