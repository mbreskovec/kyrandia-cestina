FAUN
Faun, what's this about the Wheels of Fate?
And where's Marko?
Marko and the Hand just left.
Big hurry.
Open another portal.
I've got to come back.
Sorry, no more blueberries left.
Great!
What's this about the Wheels of Fate?
Up in the clouds, past the Enchanted Forest.
The Kyrandian wheels are stuck or something.
Swell.
I'll start heading that way, but you go look for more blueberries so you can open another portal.
I don't want to have to walk the whole way.
