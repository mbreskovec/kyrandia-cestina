I thought there would be more places to shop here.
Found the path yet?
Would I still be here?
So, I hear your King Brandon is an eligible bachelor.
Is your hat in the ring?
Brandon!
Ha!
A little young for my tastes.
So, is there somebody else?
One of the famous Royal Mystics?
Naw.
I have sort of a boyfriend, but he's acting really weird lately.
What do you mean, your boyfriend is acting weird?
He's not my boyfriend.
Just sort of, you know.
Ah, a secret romance.
How very sweet.
Do you mind if we don't discuss my personal life?
Vents and rocks.
The head mystic back home said I was supposed to do something with rocks and vents...
But I had no idea this is what he meant.
So what kind of calamity has befallen Miltonia?
Rain of frogs.
Happens every summer.
Disgusting, really.
Yeech!
My name is Zanthia.
I'm here from Kyrandia.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Jessica, apprentice wizard from Miltonia.
No thanks.
That smoke stinks.
Hot air.
Weird fruit.
Volcanic bonsai.
Sturdy crystals.
I don't want to do that.
Wow, that's hot!
Clear water.
Strange island.
