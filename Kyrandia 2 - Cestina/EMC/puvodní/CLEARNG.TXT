This one came loose.
Now how am I going to scale that roof?
I'm not climbing up there without my Alchemist's Magnet.
This icicle might just help...
This won't help me climb up there.
That icicle is frozen in place.
There's no way to budge that one.
Frozen in place.
I didn't think such a steep roof would hold snow.
How'd they get the lumber up here?
Time to give Faun another call...
