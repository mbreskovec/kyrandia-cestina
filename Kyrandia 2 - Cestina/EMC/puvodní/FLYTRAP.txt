The stump is empty.
Look what I found!
Hidden safely away.
There's already something in there.
FLYTRAP
I could have done that.
Please, let me help you.
I'm not sure how much help you would be.
Fine, but if you ever need me I'll be there.
Hey! Let him down!
I guess it won't eat that.
I guess it's not hungry for that.
It's already got it's mouth full!
Are you having fun Marko?
Very funny, Zanthia.
I came to help you out.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Please Zanthia! Let me help you!
You know, I've always loved you.
Thanks for the snack.
No, but thanks.
Why don't you go play with your hand?
He's around here somewhere.
He seems to love walking in this swamp.
Thanks.
No, thanks though.
Hey! My old spellbook from magician's school!
Hey! Who ripped out all the pages!
My little camping cauldron!
The thief must have hid it here...
Too small to make portal potions, but at least it's something.
Swamp water.
Too many weeds.
Well well well.
Marko! What happened to you?
What?!
I like doing this!
I've come to help you.
