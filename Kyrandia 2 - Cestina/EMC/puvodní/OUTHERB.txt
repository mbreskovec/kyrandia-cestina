I already picked the fireberry that grew there.
That should cool them down.
A fireberry...
I've heard King Brandon's horror stories.
Why take only one when I can have two?
I'd hate to leave any of these left growing in the swamp.
Ouch! That fireberry is too hot to pick...
Is there some way to cool it off?

Swamp water.
Herb's house.
Herb's patio.
