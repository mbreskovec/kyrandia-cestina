Nice bobber.
We think so.
Hush, you'll scare away the fish.
Try this as bait...
...It looks like a worm.
Nah...
We don't use live bait.
To tell the truth, we never have actually caught anything.
Here, try this cheese for bait!
At this point I'll try anything.
You're welcome.
Thanks for the snack.
We didn't have time to pack a lunch.
THAT won't work as bait!
Nice view.
Sturdy chain...
Better than the boat.
Gorgeous mountains!
Swamp water.
Well, I am a little thirsty...

Eeesh! That can't be good for my split ends.
Stop! You'll scare the fish.
Well said.
